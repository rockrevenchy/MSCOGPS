My Sweet Collection Of General Purpose Scripts

It's just a collection of useful scripts I made with time, thought i'd share

it contains file organisation scripts as well as some specific tools
I often require such as:

-  (linux) Disk Imager (a sort of cheaper version of Norton Ghost using dd) 
-  (linux/win) File organiser by extension or date 
-  (linux/win) Identical files finder (based on checksums)  
-  (Linux) Modular general purpose installer
-  (linux) Java 8 addition for linux (as a side java installation)
-  (linux/win) System information gathering script
etc.

Most scripts are very simple yet very useful.
